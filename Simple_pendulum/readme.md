# Hello! 

This is supposed to be palce where I'll put some Julia code in some random stuff that might interest me from time to time. And this is what I've been doing: 

## Simlpe Pendulum 

- Solving the simple pendulum for some value of initial conditions. 

- Plotting the simple pendulum phase-space trajectories for a set of initial conditions.
